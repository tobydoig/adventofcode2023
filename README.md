# adventofcode2023
It's the [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/2023) competition for 2023. Will I have more time to spend on it this year?
As before, each day's puzzle is in a folder called 01, 02, 03 etc. Typically I use nodejs to write these since
it's quick to develop, in which case running `node p1.js` or `node p2.js` will run puzzles 1 and 2 for that day.
However, I *might* use Python for some as I could use the practise, in which case `python p1.py` or `python p2.py` should do it.
